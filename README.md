My research to this point has consisted of two project themes: modeling interstellar chemistry with rate kinetics models and observations of young stellar objects and old stars with infrared spectrographs.  Both are data-intensive, though in different scopes. The chemical models I run output abundances for ~1000 chemical species at ~500 timesteps covering ~10<sup>7</sup> years. This generates a fairly large file from which I plot the growth and destruction of various species, in an attempt to either match observations or make predictions for future observations.
